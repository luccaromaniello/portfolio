          <p>I began my career as a software developer, where I quickly realized the power of technology to bring ideas to life. As I collaborated with talented designers, I found myself drawn to the creative side of development, which led me to shift my focus towards design. Despite the shift, I continued to develop my technical expertise through a Software Engineering degree.</p>
          <p>Over time, working closely with teams to create user-focused and technically feasible solutions was rewarding, but I found myself missing the problem-solving aspect of development — the challenge of figuring out how to make things work. I missed the thrill of solving complex challenges and the satisfaction of building functional, interactive experiences from the ground up.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm excited to fully embrace frontend development, where I can leverage both my design sensibilities and technical expertise. I thrive in environments that push me to innovate, and I’m ready to take on new challenges where I can continue learning and building impactful digital products.</p>
